      <h2>Article Summary</h2>
      <p class="summary">The evolution of design as well as design tools for the web
        has been ongoing since 1989, when websites weren't easily accessible to the
        population. The interaction between computer and human was bridged by black
        backgrounds and one color tone pixels. A few years later, browsers became readily
        available and allowed pictures to be displayed to users. This revolutionary step
        together with the concept of tables that already existed within HTML gave way to
        structure of information within websites at the time. As with any technology,
        this came with known limitations as well as high maintenance for the designer and
        developer. At the same time HTML tables were becoming mainstream, Javascript
        started emerging to cover the gaps tables left on websites and to add relatively
        dynamic features to websites. Shortly after, Flash was born and allowed design with
        more freedom and animation. When 1998 came around, CSS started being used by
        developers to style the website's HTML structure - keeping structure separated
        from design. Unfortunately, the delay in browser adaptation was a concern for
        developers and designers alike. </p>
      <p class="summary">With the iPhone, came the mobile uprising which secured the way of grids and
        frameworks to make content across devices somewhat consistent and easier to adapt
        to which led to the responsive design era in 2010, when it was established that
        the same content should be displayed on different media types, but with different
        design layouts to fit different sized screens. This focus on content, inevitably
        led towards the flat design trend which placed the focus of the website on content,
        rather than distractions on the website or the design itself. Less is more became
        the new standard for nicely designed websites. </p>
      <p class="summary">Now, the trend seems to be continuing into the direction of less is more with
        an emphasis of flexibility -  a kind of flexibility that allows even those who do
        not know what HTML is, to create a relatively nice website. On the other hand, with
        the recent change into CSS3 and HTML5, more concepts have been added to make designing
        and developing for the web more pleasing to designers and developers alike. I can
        only hope that the trend of minimalism and focus on content continues with an
        increased effort towards usability and cross compatibility so a website can be seem
        as it was intended across every device and/or browser.</p>

      <h2>Excerpt of "A brief history of web design for designers"</h2>
      <p class="excerpt"> My interest in coding my designs was lost at the the moment
        I realized how much trickery had to be done to make it happen. Seemingly simple
        issues could be solved in so many ways. Yet it still might not have worked on
        some browsers.
          One thing that always made me wonder is why there's a division between design
          and code. Why difficult things become more simpler, but simple things become
          more difficult? </p>
      <p class="excerpt">So instead of debating whether designers should learn code or d
        evelopers should learn design, let's set some common ground on how design for the
        web evolved and how we could bridge the gap between code and design.</p>
